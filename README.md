Physically Based Rendering With OpenGL. An attempt to render atmosferic effects

This is a demo project where I build an application to render the Earth from space using high-resolution textures created by NASA. The atmospheric scattering uses the full equations from Nishita et al. 1993 in a GPU shader that runs in real-time. The demo was implemented in C++ with OpenGL and GLSL.

The code is heavily based in [Chapter 16 of the GPU Gems 2 Book](http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter16.html)
